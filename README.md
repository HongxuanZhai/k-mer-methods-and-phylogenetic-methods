# k-mer-methods-and-phylogenetic-methods

## Overview

Users can find codes and tutorials for data analysis in the paper. In the paper,
we mainly discussed two scenarios where the first one is that the practitioners have
16S sequencing data along with a phylogenetic tree. In this case, we can manage to compare the
k-mer-based distances directly with the phylogenetic $\beta$-diversity measures. The code/data/tutorials
in this situation can be found in folder

In reality, it is more likely that the practitioners only have shotgun shotgun metagenome sequencing results.
We also show how the k-mer-based distances vary across a range of values of k. The codes of data processing and
k-mer-counting can be found in folder
