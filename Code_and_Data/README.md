# Descriptions

## What is in code folder

The code folder contains tutorials for how to do simulations on three different types of
phylogenetic trees (complete binary tree, comb tree and real tree) and for how to generate
some important figures in the paper.

```
simulation-tutorial.ipynb
```
has the details on how we do simulations using JC69 models on different trees. The figures of eigenvectors
are mainly used to prove the theoretically findings using simulation strategy. And the observations are in concordance
with the descriptions in the main paper.

```
kmer-analysis-tutorial.Rmd
```
has the details of how we generate figures for comparing the k-mer-based distances and phylogenetic beta-diversity
measures on the gut microbiome dataset described in section 3.8.


## What is in data folder

The data folder has the corresponding tree files in newick format, the gut microbiome data object.
